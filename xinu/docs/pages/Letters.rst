---------------

I'd just like to say thanks for making your xinu wiki pages available on
the web. I have found them useful (particularly the example of using CFE
to boot over the network, which is suggested in the CFE functional spec,
but which I haven't seen documented anywhere else).

Reading about xinu makes me wish that I was back in school (attended
decades ago).

| anyway, thanks again.
