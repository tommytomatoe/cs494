**Embedded Xinu** is an ongoing research and implementation project in
the area of Operating Systems and Embedded Systems. Its original goal
was to re-implement and port the `Xinu Operating System <Xinu>`__ to
several embedded MIPS platforms, such as the Linksys WRT54GL router.
Since then, Embedded Xinu has been ported to other platforms, such as
the `QEMU MIPSel virtual environment <mipsel-qemu>`__ and the `Raspberry
Pi <Raspberry Pi>`__; see the `list of supported
platforms <list of supported platforms>`__. Although Embedded Xinu is
still being developed and ported to new platforms, a laboratory
environment and curriculum materials are already in use for courses in
Operating Systems, Hardware Systems, Embedded Systems, Networking, and
Compilers at Marquette University and other colleges/universities.

The Embedded Xinu project was conceived and is supervised by `Dr. Dennis
Brylow <http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/>`__ and is being conducted by
both graduate and undergraduate students in the `Systems
Laboratory <Systems Laboratory>`__ in the `Math, Statistics, & Computer
Science <http://www.mscs.mu.edu/>`__ department of `Marquette
University <http://www.mu.edu/>`__ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The first
major phase of work on Embedded Xinu began in the Summer of 2006.

Our project partners include `Dr. Bina
Ramamurthy <http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~bina/>`__ at University of
Buffalo (with whom we shared an `NSF
CCLI <http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2009/nsf09529/nsf09529.html>`__ grant),
`Dr. Paul Ruth <http://cs.olemiss.edu/~ruth/wiki/doku.php>`__ at
University of Mississippi, and `Dr. Doug
Comer <http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/comer>`__ (father of Xinu) at
Purdue University.

Teaching With Embedded Xinu
---------------------------

-  For curriculum guidance on adopting or adapting Embedded Xinu for
   undergraduate coursework, see `Teaching With
   Xinu <Teaching With Xinu>`__.
-  Workshops have been held regarding teaching with Embedded Xinu. For
   example, the `Teaching With Embedded Xinu
   Workshop <http://www.cs.olemiss.edu/acmse2010/pdf/xinu.pdf>`__ at
   `ACMSE 2010 <http://www.cs.olemiss.edu/acmse2010/Home.htm>`__ in
   Oxford, Mississippi (Ole Miss campus) shared ready-made curriculum
   resources that have been used successfully to teach hardware systems,
   operating systems, realtime/embedded systems, networking, and
   compilers with the Embedded Xinu platform at several
   colleges/universities.

Building an Embedded Xinu Laboratory
------------------------------------

In this section we are developing instructions so that other groups can
benefit from the work we are doing. These guides can be followed more or
less in order to create a relatively inexpensive platform for a custom
operating system. As our work develops further, there will be more
Xinu-specific information.

#. Obtain a `supported platform <List of supported platforms>`__.
#. `Modify the Linksys hardware <HOWTO:Modify the Linksys hardware>`__
   or `Modify the ASUS hardware <HOWTO:Modify the ASUS hardware>`__
#. `Connect to a modified router <HOWTO:Connect to a modified router>`__
#. `Build Xinu <HOWTO:Build Xinu>`__
#. `Deploy Xinu <HOWTO:Deploy Xinu>`__
#. (Optional) `Build a pool of backends <HOWTO:Build Backend Pool>`__
#. (Recommended) `Backup your router's factory
