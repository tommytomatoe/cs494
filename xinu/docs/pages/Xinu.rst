Xinu
====

**Xinu** (**"Xinu is not unix"**) is a small, academic operating system
to teach the concepts of operating systems to students. Developed at
Purdue University by Dr. Douglas E. Comer in the early 1980s for the
LSI-11 platform, it has now been ported to a variety of platforms.

**Embedded Xinu** is an update of this project which attempts to
modernize the code base and port the system to modern architectures such
as MIPS, while keeping the original goals of teaching operating system
concepts to students.
