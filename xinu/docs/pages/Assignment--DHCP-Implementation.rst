Assignment: DHCP Implementation
===============================

Overview
--------

This assignment is part of the `Networking With
Xinu <Networking With Xinu>`__ track for professors that are `Teaching
With Xinu <Teaching With Xinu>`__ and it is intended to be completed in
groups of two or three.

Preparation
~~~~~~~~~~~

A new tar-ball is provided with a solution to the previous assignment.
If your solution is similar to the one presented, you may choose to
continue on with it; but it is suggested that you untar the new project
files in a fresh working directory: tar xvzf

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
-----------------------------------

The `Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol <wikipedia:Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol>`__ provides a
framework for passing configuration information to hosts on a TCPIP
network. DHCP is based on the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP). In this
assignment students will build a DHCP client into Embedded Xinu that
dynamically acquires networking information for the operating system to
use.

Upon completion of the assignment the students' implementation should:

Required Assignment Parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  implement a functional DHCP client within Embedded Xinu

Student Outcomes
----------------

Upon completion of this assignment students should understand the key
role this protocol plays in the overall networking architecture.
