Trunk
=====

Trunk refers to the latest version of Embedded XINU in our source code
repositories. This is most likely not the version that is available for
downloading, but rather a more feature-rich (and slightly buggy)
version.

If you wish to obtain the trunk version please contact
``brylow{at}mscs{dot}mu{dot}edu``.
