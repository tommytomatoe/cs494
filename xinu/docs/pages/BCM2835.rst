BCM2835
=======

The **BCM2835** is a SoC (System-on-a-chip) designed by Broadcom. It is
used on the `Raspberry Pi <Raspberry Pi>`__, where it is easily visible
as the black chip in the center of the board. The chip contains many of
the components of a traditional computer, such as a CPU, memory, and a
GPU.

The BCM2835 is actually not specific to the `Raspberry
Pi <Raspberry Pi>`__ and is used in at least one other consumer device
(the Roku
2)\ http://www.electronicproducts.com/Roku_2_XS_3100R_Streaming_Media_Adapter-whatsinside_text-120.aspx</ref>.
