Interrupt handling: Raspberry Pi
================================

Interrupt handling on the `Raspberry Pi <Raspberry Pi>`__ is concerned
with all software and hardware used to configure and process
`interrupts <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt>`__. An example of
an interrupt that can be enabled on the `Raspberry Pi <Raspberry Pi>`__
is that from the `BCM2835 System Timer <BCM2835 System Timer>`__, which
is used in XinuPi to implement `preemptive
multitasking <Preemptive_Multitasking_(ARM)>`__. Interrupt handling on
the `Raspberry Pi <Raspberry Pi>`__ consists of two complementary parts:

-  `Interrupt handling (ARM) <Interrupt handling (ARM)>`__
-  `BCM2835 Interrupt Controller <BCM2835 Interrupt Controller>`__
