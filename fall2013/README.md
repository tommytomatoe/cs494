# Raspberry Pi Journal

## Keeping track with my Pi adventures

Each log will be created in a file called "logxx.md", where "xx" is a two digit
number. The logs will be written in Git markdown syntax, so they will be
viewable in Gitlab or Github.

Git repository is hosted at http://git.classic.cx/utk/cs494 (private) and
https://github.com/tommytomatoe/cs494 (public).

To download the repository, clone from either remote:

Gitlab: `git clone http://git.classic.cx/utk/cs494.git`

Github: `git clone https://github.com/tommytomatoe/cs494.git`

Enjoy!
