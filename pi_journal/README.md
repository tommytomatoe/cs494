# Raspberry Pi Journal

## Keeping track with my Pi adventures

Each log will be created in a file called "logxx.md", where "xx" is a two digit
number. The logs will be written in Git markdown syntax, so they will be
viewable in Gitlab or Github.

## Log Index

log00 - In the Beginning  
log01 - Installing Arch Linux ARM   
log02 - Install Essential Packages (audio, video, desktop)
