### In the beginning

This is the very first log.

My Raspberry Pi arrived on Thursday, August 29, 2013. I should clarify when I
say "arrived". It really should have arrived Tuesday, August 27, 2013. However,
as fate would have it, FedEx did not ship it that day. They also did not ship it
the following day. Instead, on Wednesday, August 28, 2013, it was shipped to
USPS. Finally, on Thursday, I went to USPS and picked up my brand new Pi.
