### Baking Pi

The very first thing I did with the Pi was load it up with my favorite GNU/Linux
distro - Arch Linux. Arch's philosophy can be summed up with KISS - keep it
simple, stupid. Simplicity makes Unix what it is. Using a distro such as Arch
just makes sense.

### Installing Arch Linux ARM

Installing Arch Linux ARM was super easy. I was up and running in less than five
minutes. Here are the steps I took. My development machine:

- MacBook Pro 2011 
  - Sandy Bridge i7-2720qm
  - 16GB RAM
  - 256GB Crucial SSD
- Dual boot using rEFInd 
- Arch Linux is the primary OS
- OS X Mountain Lion for Mac-specific tasks
- Windows 7 Enterprise in a Virtual Box VM



1. Downloaded Arch Linux Arm using this [torrent](http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/images/archlinuxarm/archlinux-hf-2013-07-22/archlinux-hf-2013-07-22.img.zip.torrent).
  * Using the torrent was much faster than the direct downloads.
  * The download came in a .zip file (archlinux-hf-2013-07-22.img.zip). 
2. Unzipped the download to get the .img file 
  * `unzip archlinux-hf-2013-07-22.img.zip`
