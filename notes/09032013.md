#### 1. What is the purpose of the file system? What are its most important resources, structures and functions?
1. Present a logical or abstract view of files and directories to the users by
   hiding the physical details of secondary storage devices and the I/O
   operations for communicating with teh devices.
2. Facilitate efficient use of the underlying storage devices.
3. Support the sharing of files among different users and applications. This
   includes providing protection mechanisms to ensure that information is
   exchanged in a controlled and secure manner.

Operations on files: Create/Delete, Open/Close, Read/Write, Seek/Rewind

Simple answer: yes for performance reasons. Overhead of microkernel if outside
the kernel space.
